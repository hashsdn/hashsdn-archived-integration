## Deprecation Notice

The OpenDaylight Integration project split into thirds in August 2015. The
code in this repository was removed to prevent confusion. The three new
projects contain up-to-date versions of the code that was hosted here. All
previous versions of the code are available via version control.

To checkout a brach with the old code:

 git checkout -b old_codebase HEAD~1
